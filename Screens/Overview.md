# Screen Overview – ZVIM Module Pool

This application uses classic SAP Dynpro screens
to guide the user through vendor invoice processing.

## Screen Flow
0100 – Invoice Header (Create / Edit)
→ 0200 – Invoice Items
→ 0300 – Invoice List (ALV)

## Design Principles
- Business logic separated from screen logic
- Subscreens used for reusability
- Mode-driven UI behavior
